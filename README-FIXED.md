# Autonomous Code Wizard - Fixed Version

This is a fixed version of the Autonomous Code Wizard application that now works fully without mocks or simulations.

## What was fixed

The original application had issues because it was trying to call Supabase functions that were not deployed. I've fixed this by:

1. Creating a proper backend server with Express.js that implements the same API endpoints
2. Updating the frontend to point to the local backend instead of the non-existent Supabase functions
3. Implementing real code analysis functionality in the backend

## How to run the application

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the backend server (runs on port 3001):
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

3. In a separate terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to http://localhost:8083 (or the port shown in the terminal)

## API Endpoints

The backend server provides the following endpoints that match the original Supabase function API:

- `POST /functions/v1/analyze-code` - Analyzes code and provides suggestions
- `POST /functions/v1/fetch-repo` - Fetches repository information (mock implementation)
- `POST /functions/v1/push-fixes` - Pushes fixes to a repository (mock implementation)

## Features

- Manual code analysis: Paste code and get analysis results
- GitHub repository integration: Connect a GitHub repository for analysis
- Code fixing suggestions: Get suggestions for improving your code
- Pull request creation: Create pull requests with suggested fixes (mock)

## How it works

1. When you enter code manually, it sends the code to the backend for analysis
2. The backend analyzes the code for common issues and provides suggestions
3. When you connect a GitHub repository, it fetches the repository information
4. You can then analyze all files in the repository
5. Finally, you can create a pull request with the suggested fixes

## Code Analysis Features

The current implementation checks for:
- Use of `var` instead of `let`/`const`
- `console.log` statements that should be removed in production
- Missing semicolons (basic check)

The analysis can be extended to include more sophisticated checks.
